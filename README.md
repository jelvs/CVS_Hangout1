# Hangout 1

##  Your mission is to complete the method **XorSet**. 
Completely specify the methods by writing the weakest pre-condition and the strongest post-condition possible. 
Implement and verify the methods according to that same specification.

## Consider the given functions unique, contains, and isSet.
    
    - Specify and implement method XorSet below. The functionality of this method
    it to return the array (and the corresponding number of elements) containing 
    the elements that are in one of the arrays (a or b) but not in both. The arrays
    are given as parameters together with their number of elements (na or nb).

    - Both arrays are considered "sets", having no repetitions. The resulting array
    should also be a "set".

    - In the specification, define the weakest preconditions and the strongest 
    postconditions you can think of. Implement and verify the method so that it
    satisfies the post-conditions assuming the pre-conditions.

## The due date is Friday, 12 of April, 23h59m.
